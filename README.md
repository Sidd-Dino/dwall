# dwall

## requirements
```
bash 4+
feh
```

## installation
```
make install
```

## configuration
The first run of dwall creates a config file at `~/.dwall.conf`
```
wallpaper_dir : the directory from which it will pick images
feh_flags     : the flags that will be passed to feh
delay         : the delay between the changing pics
```

## why i made it?
Just cos i needed a script that automatically changes the wallpaper
